# Advent-Of-Code-2022

Repository for my work on the Advent Of Code 2022 challenges

https://adventofcode.com/2022

### Basic Info

I'm sticking to fundamentals: using JS/TS with Deno, not going for speed, just
seeing how far I get

I am also using this project as an opportunity to practice some Agile strategies

Naturally, later Days tend to contain more sophisticated code

### Notes

Warning: files labelled notes.md are for scratch note-taking most of their
content is not written with the intention of being readable for anyone besides
myself

- They do contain handy links to the challenges for individual Days' pages
  though!

### ToDo

ToDo contains known opportunities and fresh ideas for improving this project

### Retrospectives

Retrospectives contain reflections on that Day's work

### app.ts

Files labelled app.ts are runnable and will return that Day's solutions as well
as log solution messages to the console. They can be run from inside that Day's
directory by running `deno run app.ts` in the terminal
