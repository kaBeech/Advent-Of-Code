# Advent-Of-Code

Repository for my work on the [Advent Of Code challenges](https://adventofcode.com/)

If you're interested, [I'm also building a mod to add a bonus layer of randomized challenge to these puzzles](https://github.com/kaBeech/Advent-Of-Code-QSLs-Mod)

## Individual Years

This started as a repo for my work on the 2022 challenges, but has since been updated to include earlier changes

Note that the years indicate the year the challenges were debuted on the Advent Of Code website, not necessarily the year I complete them. For example, I started the 2021 challenges in May 2023

### 2022-Thorough

In this group of challenges I focus on thoroughness and code quality, including modular components, unit testing, and error handling

This aspect wasn't as focused on in the first few days, so you can see the thoroughness improve as the days progress (with the possible exception of Day10)

These challenges are completed with TypeScript/JavaScript with Deno

### 2021-Fast

In this group of challenges I focus on speed!

I started this folder while midway through the 2022 challenges as a more fun outlet for my coding energies

These challenges are completed with TypeScript/JavaScript with Deno

### 2020-Rust

In this group of challenges I focus less on speed and thoroughness, and more on learning about Rust

I love Rust, but I don't have the same depth of experience with it that I do with JavaScript, so this is an opportunity to learn more about the intricacies of how Rust works

These challenges are completed with Rust!

## Retrospectives

Retrospectives contain reflections on that Day's work
