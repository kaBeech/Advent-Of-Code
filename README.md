# Advent-Of-Code

Repository for my work on the Advent Of Code challenges

https://adventofcode.com/


## Basic Info

I'm sticking to fundamentals: using JS/TS with Deno, not going for speed, just
seeing how far I get while building a progressively more sophisticated code base

I am also using this project as an opportunity to practice some Agile strategies
such as prioritizing working code, iterative/incremental/evolutionary
development, continuous refactoring, periodic retrospectives, SCRUM, Test Driven
Development, and Pair Programming

Naturally, later Days tend to contain more sophisticated code and strategies
than earlier ones

## Individual Years

- Note that the years indicate the year the challenges were debuted on the Advent Of Code website, not necessarily the year I complete them. For example, I started the 2021 challenges in May 2023

### 2022-Thorough

In this group of challenges I focus on thoroughness and code quality, including modular components, unit testing, and error handling

This wasn't as [focused on] in the first few days, so you can see the thoroughness improve as the days progress (with the possible exception of Day10)

These challenges are completed with TypeScript/JavaScript with Deno

### 2021-Fast

In this group of challenges I focus on speed!

I started this folder while midway through the 2022 challenges as a more fun outlet for my coding energies

These challenges are completed with TypeScript/JavaScript with Deno

### 2020-Rust

In this group of challenges I focus less on speed and thoroughness, and more on learning about Rust

I LOVE Rust, but I don't have the same depth of experience with it that I do with JavaScript, so this is an opportunity to learn more about the intricacies of how Rust works

These challenges are completed with Rust!

## Retrospectives

Retrospectives contain reflections on that Day's work
