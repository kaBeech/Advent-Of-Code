# What went well during the sprint?

### It's good to be back!

- Christmas in May???

    - Sure, why not!

    - I finally decided to take some time and do another of these. We'll see if I have time for more soon <3

### Writing modular code

- I like that I can solve the Part 2's on these with small tweaks to the Part 1 code. Good on me for writing modular code!

## Takeaways

- Have fun!

- It's good to be back!

# What can I learn from difficult points?

### I can assume properly formatted input for these challenges

- I found myself spending more time writing error handling and tests for improperly formatted input than I liked. That was less fun. In the future I may write these assuming proper input. That sounds like more fun!

## Takeaways

- I can assume proper input for these going forward!

# Ideas for possible future implementaion

### Assume properly formatted input

- See above. More coding, less worrying about unneccessary hypotheticals, more fun!

### Maybe speedrun a day or two?

- I found myself slogging through parts of this. This series of challenges I'm focusing on good quality code, but it might be fun play do a day or two closer to how they're intended (or at least how most people seem to do them). Maybe I'll start a folder to do 2021's challenges in a more speedrun style!

### Maybe try in Rust?

- It was kinda funny doing these kinds of puzzles in TypeScript after dipping my toes into Rust. I'm starting to see why so many people have hot takes on JavaScript/TypeScript. Maybe I'll start a folder to do a previous year's challenges in Rust too!
