# Advent-Of-Code-2020

Repository for my work on the Advent Of Code 2020 challenges

https://adventofcode.com/2021

## Basic Info

In this group of challenges I focus less on speed and thoroughness, and more on learning about Rust

I LOVE Rust, but I don't have the same depth of experience with it that I do with JavaScript, so this is an opportunity to learn more about the intricacies of how Rust works

## Notes

Warning: files labelled notes.md are for scratch note-taking and much of their
content is not written with the intention of being readable for anyone besides
myself

- They do contain handy links to the pages for individual Days' challenges
  though!

## Retrospectives

Retrospectives contain reflections on that Day's work
