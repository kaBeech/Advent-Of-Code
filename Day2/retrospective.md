# What went well during the sprint?

### Writing good code

In defiance of the takeapays from my last retrospective I took the 
time to do things 'the right way' this time, and I feel good about 
that! It took more time, but I had the time today and it feels 
better writing code closer to how I'd do it in 'the real world' 

I did take my advice and focused more on getting the code working 
before getting too bogged down in structure. I think I found a good 
balance this time, which seems important for Agile development

I aim to be able to whip up similar structures more quickly
as I gain practice

### Testing

I did implement testing this time and it didn't seem to take an
exorbitant amount of time and energy to do so. This was made easier 
by adding proper typing as most issues would throw a Type Error
and get caught by TypeScript automatically

Having testing written helped keep nme focused while coding as I 
had a clearer map to guide my progres. It also made debugging easier

### Using Modules

Breaking up the code into Modules maybe takes more time, but it sure 
makes me feel better! I kept my focus and stayed in flow while 
also thinking about structure and reusability. Now that I have a 
handy template on this Day I can reference it for future Days 
and speed up development while using Modules!

Also, this enabled me to make a 'tools' folder with modules that I 
excpect may come in handy later

## Takeaways

* Keep in the flow
* Use code from previous Days as templates
* Store handy reusable modules in the tools folder
* Have fun!

# What I learn from difficult points?

### Be careful with Git

Somehow I when merging my branches after completing Part 2 I 
reverted my repo on GitHub to the point before starting Part 2. 
Thankfully Iwas able to easily recover the data from my local Git. 
But it's a good reminder to be careful with Git and do most Git 
operations locally. I wonder if it would be a good idea to 
submit PR's, merge, and delete branches locally instead of on GitHub?

### Think about streamlining retrospectives

I too a while to write up this retrospective. I'm glad I did because 
I had some good thoughts and it's still early on (i.e. I'm still 
laying foundations for this project). For future retrospectives 
I may make it a goal to streamline them for better time and energy 
usage

## Takeaways

* Be careful with Git
* Consider doing PR operations locally
* Think about streamlining retrospectives

# Ideas for possible future implementaion

### Add error handling
...if needed. So far I think I've gotten good error coverage just 
from setting adequate Types
