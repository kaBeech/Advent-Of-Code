XXC.23 Day 13: Sports Themed Declarations

_This post is an entry documenting my journey working through the Advent of Code 2023 challenges using my Xtreme Xmas Code mod_

SPORTS!

Challenge Modifier: "Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle naming all declarations in a random theme selected from the Theme Box: Sports"

This challenge was a welcome reprieve from my struggles with Chat-GPT yesterday. It was fun thinking of sports metaphors and I got a chuckle out of mixing metaphors (like rebounding with yard lines).

This puzzle was pretty straightforward, but using metaphors unrelated to the original puzzle was a nice brain stretch.

Again, not much more to say about this one!

Thanks for joining me on this journey! If you'd like to see today's puzzle, it's over at Advent of Code. If you'd like to see my puzzle solutions, my source code is available on GitHub. And if you'd also like to give my mod a try, head over to Xtreme Xmas Code. Links to all three are in the comments!

ðŸŽ„ Happy holidays everyone! ðŸŽ„
