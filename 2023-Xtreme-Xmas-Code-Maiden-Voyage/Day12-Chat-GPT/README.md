### Challenge Modifier

"Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle using ChatGPT (the free, GPT-3.5 version) exclusively (no editing Chat's responses - you must edit your prompts!)"

Sounds good! I considered rerolling this, since I got it once before already, but I'm a couple days behind on my puzzles so I'll keep this one for now =)

### Retrospective

XXC.23 Day 12: Chat-GPT (again!)

_This post is an entry documenting my journey working through the Advent of Code 2023 challenges using my Xtreme Xmas Code mod_

Okay, Computer...

Challenge Modifier "Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle using ChatGPT (the free, GPT-3.5 version) exclusively (no editing Chat's responses - you must edit your prompts!)"

I considered rerolling this, since I got it once before already, but I was a couple days behind on my puzzles so I decided keep this one.

That sure was an interesting choice.

In contrast to my first puzzle working with Chat, this time was a major struggle. Feel free to read through the logs of our chat for Part 1 if you enjoy witnessing my pain.

One thing that might be of interest is that in order to make the problem simpler for Chat to understand, I changed the phrasing of the puzzle from taking rows of springs and finding arrangements of groups of damaged springs to taking boxes boxes and finding arrangements of items to fit into those boxes.

I don't know if doing this helped Chat or not, but it certainly helped me avoid typing 'string' when I meant 'spring!'

I got so fed up with this process that after finishing Part 1 and realizing I needed to rewrite much of our code for Part 2, I took a break from this puzzle for several days.

When I returned, I decided to start over completely, write the main bit of the code myself, and then interpret that to Chat.

I found this process much more enjoyable. I wrote the prototype in TypeScript and Chat wrote the final program in Python, so it was fun comparing the code in different languages. Editing Chat's Python to match my TypeScript was a lot easier and more fun than wrapping my head around Chat's Python from scratch.

This also gives me an idea for relating AI to the concepts in Peter Naur's _Programming as Theory Building_. This isn't the time or the space for that though, so I'm leaving a note for myself here to follow up on later...

Thanks for joining me on this journey! If you'd like to see today's puzzle, it's over at Advent of Code. If you'd like to see my puzzle solutions, my source code is available on GitHub. And if you'd also like to give my mod a try, head over to Xtreme Xmas Code. Links to all three, as well as to my chat logs for these solutions, are in the comments!
