### Challenge Modifier

"Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle using ChatGPT (the free, GPT-3.5 version) exclusively (no editing Chat's responses - you must edit your prompts!)"

Sounds good! I considered rerolling this, since I got it once before already, but I'm a couple days behind on my puzzles so I'll keep this one for now =)
