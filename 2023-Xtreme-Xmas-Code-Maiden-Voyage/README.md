# Advent of Code Solutions 2023: <br>Xtreme Xmas Code's Maiden Voyage

This is a repository for my work on the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. This year I'm using my [Xtreme Xmas Code](https://www.xtremexmascode.com/) mod for the first (official) time!

## Basic Info

Every day, Xtreme Xmas Code will [roll me a challenge modifier](https://www.xtremexmascode.com/about) to add an extra layer of unpredictable fun!

I expect to code in languages I've never used before, to practice strictly following specific principles, maybe even to write a program without using the letter 'c'

Barring any and all surprises, I'll plan on using TypeScript with Deno by default

I'll also be posting my progress each day on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-beechly/)

## README.md

Files labelled README.md contain links to that day on Xtreme Xmas Code and information about that day (which Challenge Modifiers were rolled, evidence of Challenge Modifier completion, any additional information, etc.)

## Notes

Files labelled notes.md are for scratch note-taking and much of their
content is not written with the intention of being readable for anyone besides
myself

- They do contain handy links to the Advent of Code pages for individual Days' challenges
  though!

## Running the application

Files named solvePart1.ts and solvePart2.ts will usually be executable and return that Day's solutions as well as log solution messages to the console. They can generally be run from inside that Day's directory by running `deno run --allow-read solvePart1.ts ` and `deno run --allow-read solvePart2.ts ` in the terminal. However, this is all subject to the Day's rolled Challenge Modifiers
