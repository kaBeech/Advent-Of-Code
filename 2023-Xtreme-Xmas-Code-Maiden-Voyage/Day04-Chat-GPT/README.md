### Challenge Modifier

"Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle using ChatGPT (the free, GPT-3.5 version) exclusively (no editing Chat's responses - you must edit your prompts!)"

Haha, nice

### Retrospective

This was fun!

This was another challenge modifier that I hoped I'd roll. I wanted to make sure it was fun, instructive in some way, not completely trivial, but also not intensely frustrating. I found it a fun exercise in finding ways to communicate clearly with Chat-GPT to get xyr to do exactly what I wanted xyr to.

I decided to let Chat use whatever language xe wanted, since I figured xe'd know what languages xe's best at. Chat chose Python, and I feel xe did a good job in coding in Python, especially during Part 1. Part 2 got a little finnickier, but we got to a good solution without too much difficulty.

I will say that our solution for Part 2 takes about 45 seconds to run on my computer (using 8-9 year old hardware), which is a bit longer than Advent of Code's assertion that [every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about), so there's probably a lot of optimization that can be made, but overall I'm happy with the experience completing this challenge!
