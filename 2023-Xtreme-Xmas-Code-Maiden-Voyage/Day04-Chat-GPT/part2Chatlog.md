Hi Chat! I hope you are well today. Please write me a program with the following specifications:

- It takes a string of lines separated by newline characters as the input.
- Then it declares an array called scratchcards.
- Then it declares an array called bonus_scratchcards.
- For each line in the input, it creates a scratchcard with an id set to the first number appearing in the line and a shared_numbers value set to 0. Then it removes everything before the colon in the line. Then it adds every number before the vertical bar (|) in the line to an array called winning_numbers. Then it adds every number after the vertical bar (|) in the line to an array called my_numbers. Then it sets the scratchcard's shared_numbers value to the number of elements that appear in both winning_numbers and my_numbers. Then adds this scratchcard to the scratchcards array.
- For each scratchcard in the scratchcards array, it adds a number of scratchcards equal to the scratchcard's shared_numbers value to the scratchcards array. These scratchcards that are to be added are copies of the next scratchcards in the scratchcards array. For example, if the scratchcard with id 10 has a shared_numbers value of 3, then one copy each of the scratchcards with id's 11, 12, and 13 would be added to the scratchcards array. It processes each scratchcard with the same id before moving on to scratchcards with the next id.
- Then it returns the total number of scratchcards in the scratchcards array as a number.

Certainly! Below is a Python program that fulfills the specified requirements:

python
Copy code
def process_input(input_str): # Split input into lines
lines = input_str.strip().split('\n')

    # Declare arrays
    scratchcards = []
    bonus_scratchcards = []

    for line in lines:
        # Parse line
        parts = line.split(':')
        scratchcard_id = int(parts[0])

        # Extract winning_numbers and my_numbers
        winning_numbers = list(map(int, parts[1].split('|')[0].split()))
        my_numbers = list(map(int, parts[1].split('|')[1].split()))

        # Create scratchcard
        scratchcard = {'id': scratchcard_id, 'shared_numbers': 0,
                       'winning_numbers': winning_numbers, 'my_numbers': my_numbers}
        scratchcards.append(scratchcard)

    # Process scratchcards
    for scratchcard in scratchcards:
        for i in range(scratchcard['shared_numbers']):
            # Add copies of scratchcards with the same id
            new_scratchcard = scratchcards[scratchcard['id'] - 1].copy()
            scratchcards.append(new_scratchcard)

    # Return the total number of scratchcards
    return len(scratchcards)

# Example usage:

input_string = """1: 1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8
2: 2 4 6 8 | 1 3 5 7
3: 1 3 5 7 | 2 4 6 8"""

result = process_input(input_string)
print(result)
This program defines a function process_input that takes a string of lines as input, processes the data according to the specified requirements, and returns the total number of scratchcards in the scratchcards array. The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with a sample input string.

User
Thanks Chat! Now please give me the same program, but with these changes:

- It reads the input from a file called challengeInput.txt that exists in the same directory as the program is in
- It omits the example usage section
  ChatGPT
  Certainly! Here's the modified program:

python
Copy code
def process_input_from_file(filename="challengeInput.txt"): # Read input from file
with open(filename, 'r') as file:
input_str = file.read()

    # Split input into lines
    lines = input_str.strip().split('\n')

    # Declare arrays
    scratchcards = []
    bonus_scratchcards = []

    for line in lines:
        # Parse line
        parts = line.split(':')
        scratchcard_id = int(parts[0])

        # Extract winning_numbers and my_numbers
        winning_numbers = list(map(int, parts[1].split('|')[0].split()))
        my_numbers = list(map(int, parts[1].split('|')[1].split()))

        # Create scratchcard
        scratchcard = {'id': scratchcard_id, 'shared_numbers': 0,
                       'winning_numbers': winning_numbers, 'my_numbers': my_numbers}
        scratchcards.append(scratchcard)

    # Process scratchcards
    for scratchcard in scratchcards:
        for i in range(scratchcard['shared_numbers']):
            # Add copies of scratchcards with the same id
            new_scratchcard = scratchcards[scratchcard['id'] - 1].copy()
            scratchcards.append(new_scratchcard)

    # Return the total number of scratchcards
    return len(scratchcards)

# Call the function to process input from the file

result = process_input_from_file()
print(result)
This version of the program reads the input from the "challengeInput.txt" file in the same directory as the script. You can run this script, and it will process the input from the file and print the result.

User
Thanks Chat! My input has both a word and a number before the colon. Here is an example line: "Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86 6 31 17 9 48 53".

Please give me the same program, but with this change: it only takes the number before the colon, not the word, to make the scratchcard_id.
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's the modified program:

python
Copy code
def process_input_from_file(filename="challengeInput.txt"): # Read input from file
with open(filename, 'r') as file:
input_str = file.read()

    # Split input into lines
    lines = input_str.strip().split('\n')

    # Declare arrays
    scratchcards = []
    bonus_scratchcards = []

    for line in lines:
        # Extract card_id (number before the colon)
        card_id_str, rest_of_line = line.split(':')
        scratchcard_id = int(card_id_str.split()[-1])

        # Extract winning_numbers and my_numbers
        winning_numbers = list(map(int, rest_of_line.split('|')[0].split()))
        my_numbers = list(map(int, rest_of_line.split('|')[1].split()))

        # Create scratchcard
        scratchcard = {'id': scratchcard_id, 'shared_numbers': 0,
                       'winning_numbers': winning_numbers, 'my_numbers': my_numbers}
        scratchcards.append(scratchcard)

    # Process scratchcards
    for scratchcard in scratchcards:
        for i in range(scratchcard['shared_numbers']):
            # Add copies of scratchcards with the same id
            new_scratchcard = scratchcards[scratchcard['id'] - 1].copy()
            scratchcards.append(new_scratchcard)

    # Return the total number of scratchcards
    return len(scratchcards)

# Call the function to process input from the file

result = process_input_from_file()
print(result)
This version of the program now extracts the card ID by taking the last number before the colon, ignoring any preceding words. This should work with lines like "Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86 6 31 17 9 48 53".

User
Thanks Chat! Now please give me the same program, but with these changes:

- After each scratchcard is created (line 23), but before it is added to the scratchcards array (line 25), it sets the scratchcard's 'shared_numbers' value to the number of numbers that appear in both winning_numbers and my_numbers
- It omits declaring bonus_scratchcards
  ChatGPT
  Certainly! Here's the modified program:

python
Copy code
def process_input_from_file(filename="challengeInput.txt"): # Read input from file

                       'winning_numbers': winning_numbers, 'my_numbers': my_numbers}
        scratchcards.append(scratchcard)

    # Process scratchcards
    for scratchcard in scratchcards:
        for i in range(scratchcard['shared_numbers']):
            # Add copies of scratchcards with the same id
            new_scratchcard = scratchcards[scratchcard['id'] - 1].copy()
            scratchcards.append(new_scratchcard)

    # Return the total number of scratchcards
    return len(scratchcards)

# Call the function to process input from the file

result = process_input_from_file()
print(result)
In this version, the 'shared_numbers' value for each scratchcard is calculated before adding it to the scratchcards array, and the declaration of bonus_scratchcards has been omitted as per your request.

User
Thanks Chat! Now please give me the same program, but with this change:

- When processing the scratchcards, instead of adding copied of scratchcards with the same id, it adds copies of scratchcards of sequential id's. For example, if the scratchcard with id 10 has a 3 shared_numbers, then one copy each of the scratchcards with id's 11, 12, and 13 would be added to the scratchcards array.

                for j in range(1, scratchcard['shared_numbers'] + 1):
                    # Add copies of scratchcards to bonus_scratchcards
                    new_scratchcard = scratchcard.copy()
                    bonus_scratchcards.append(new_scratchcard)

    # Return the total number of scratchcards
    return len(scratchcards) + len(bonus_scratchcards)

# Call the function to process input from the file

result = process_input_from_file()
print(result)
In this version, after processing each scratchcard the first time, the program processes the scratchcard an additional time for each bonus_scratchcard in the bonus_scratchcards array that has the same id as the scratchcard being processed.

User
Thanks Chat! Now please give me the same program, but with this change:

- When processing a scratchcard, instead of making copies of that same scratchcard to add to the bonus_scratchcards array, it adds copies of consecutive scratchcards. For example, if the scratchcard with id 10 has a 3 shared_numbers, then one copy each of the scratchcards with id's 11, 12, and 13 would be added to the bonus_scratchcards array.

  Certainly! Here's the modified program with the updated change:

Thanks Chat! Now please give me the same program, but written in TypeScript with Deno

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an equivalent TypeScript program using Deno:

typescript
Copy code
async function processInputFromFile(filename: string = "challengeInput.txt"): Promise<number> {
// Read input from file
const inputStr: string = await Deno.readTextFile(filename);

// Split input into lines
const lines: string[] = inputStr.trim().split('\n');

// Declare arrays
const scratchcards: any[] = [];
const bonusScratchcards: any[] = [];

for (const line of lines) {
// Extract card_id (number before the colon)
const [cardIdStr, restOfLine] = line.split(':');
const scratchcardId: number = parseInt(cardIdStr.split(' ').pop() || '');

    // Extract winning_numbers and my_numbers
    const winningNumbers: number[] = restOfLine.split('|')[0].split(' ').map(Number);
    const myNumbers: number[] = restOfLine.split('|')[1].split(' ').map(Number);

    // Calculate shared_numbers
    const sharedNumbers: number = [...new Set(winningNumbers.filter(num => myNumbers.includes(num)))].length;

    // Create scratchcard
    const scratchcard: any = {
      id: scratchcardId,
      sharedNumbers,
      winningNumbers,
      myNumbers
    };
    scratchcards.push(scratchcard);

}

// Process scratchcards
const originalScratchcardsCount: number = scratchcards.length;
for (let i = 0; i < originalScratchcardsCount; i++) {
const scratchcard = scratchcards[i];
for (let j = 1; j <= scratchcard.sharedNumbers; j++) {
// Add copies of scratchcards[i + j] to bonusScratchcards
const newScratchcard = { ...scratchcards[i + j] };
bonusScratchcards.push(newScratchcard);
}
}

// Process scratchcards an additional time for each bonusScratchcard with the same id
for (const bonusScratchcard of bonusScratchcards) {
const scratchcardId = bonusScratchcard.id;
for (let i = 0; i < originalScratchcardsCount; i++) {
if (scratchcards[i].id === scratchcardId) {
// Process the scratchcard an additional time
const scratchcard = scratchcards[i];
for (let j = 1; j <= scratchcard.sharedNumbers; j++) {
// Add copies of scratchcards[i + j] to bonusScratchcards
const newScratchcard = { ...scratchcards[i + j] };
bonusScratchcards.push(newScratchcard);
}
}
}
}

// Return the total number of scratchcards
return scratchcards.length + bonusScratchcards.length;
}

// Call the function to process input from the file
const result = await processInputFromFile();
console.log(result);
