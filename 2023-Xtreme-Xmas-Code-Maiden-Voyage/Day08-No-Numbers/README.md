### Challenge Modifier

Part 1: "Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle using no numbers (you may convert any numbers in your challenge input)"

Ha! Since I rerolled this Modifier on Day 3 it's back for more!

Well, today's puzzle is not nearly as number-heavy as Day 3's, so let's do it!

...Well, that was easy for Part 1. Part 2 was a bit harder, but doable... until the numbers got so big that JavaScript ran out of memory

Let's go ahead and reroll!

Part 2 : "Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle making declarations in alphabetical order"

Sounds good!
