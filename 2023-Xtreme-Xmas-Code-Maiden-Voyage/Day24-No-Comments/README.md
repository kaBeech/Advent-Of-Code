### Challenge Modifier

"Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle while making 
your code as clear as possible, but using no comments"

Well, after using so many comments the past two days, this seems balanced!

After all the fussiness with Day 22, and noticing that today's puzzle involves 
floats, I'm considering using a language besides JavaScript for this challenge. 
I'll probably spend a while thinking about it - I might not have time to 
actually do the challenge for another week. I just get excited to see what 
challenges I roll!

That being said... maybe Rust? Haskell would be fun too if I can get the LSP 
to start playing nice with Vim/NixOS =)
