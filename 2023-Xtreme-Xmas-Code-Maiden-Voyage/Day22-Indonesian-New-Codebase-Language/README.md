Wow. Alright y'all. I've already used my top three languages (English, Spanish, and Arabic) in this codebase, and my fourth language (Hawai'ian) has a grammar structure that seems like it would be difficult for a novice to use while coding. So we're gonna do Indonesian! Apologies in advance for any/all mistakes =)
