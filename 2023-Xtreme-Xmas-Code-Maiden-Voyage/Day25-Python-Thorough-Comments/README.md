### Challenge Modifier

"Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle while making 
declarations in a natural language using a non-Latin-based writing system 
(e.g. Arabic)"

As noted in `./notes.md`, I'm not keen on introducing a language barrier to 
this challenge, so I'm gonna reroll this

"Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle with thorough 
comments"

Haha, looks like we're on to a theme here. Sure, let's go!

Let's also do this one in Python
