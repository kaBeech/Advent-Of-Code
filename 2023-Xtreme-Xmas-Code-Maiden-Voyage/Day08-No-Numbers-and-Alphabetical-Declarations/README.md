### Challenge Modifier

Part 1: "Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle using no numbers (you may convert any numbers in your challenge input)"

Ha! Since I rerolled this Modifier on Day 3 it's back for more!

Well, today's puzzle is not nearly as number-heavy as Day 3's, so let's do it!

...Well, that was easy for Part 1. Part 2 was a bit harder, but doable... until the numbers got so big that JavaScript ran out of memory

Let's go ahead and reroll!

Part 2 : "Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle making declarations in alphabetical order"

Sounds good!

### Points Earned

40

### Rerolls

Part 1: 0

Part 2: 1

#### Tokens Spent

Part 1: 0

Part 2: 2

### Tokens Earned

2

### Notes

- Output for Part 1 is converted to a number for convenience (so you don't have to count the elements in the array)

- If you have crazy high memory available, you may be able to make Part 2 work without numbers as well. Just use getLeastCommonMultipleWithoutNumbers() instead of getLeastCommonMultiple() and update numbers to strings

### Retrospective

This is where we reflect on the day's challenge!
