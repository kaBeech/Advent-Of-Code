### Challenge Modifier

"Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle in a programming language not yet used in this codebase"

Let's do OCAML!

Huh. For Part 1, the domain for the solution would be 4 (four quadrants) * 64 (height of a quadrant) * 64 (width of a quadrant) / 2 (each quadrant is a triangular area) / 2 (since the Elf needs to take an even number of steps, if this were a chessboard, he could only land on black tiles) tiles that the Elf could theoretically reach. Looking at the map he miiiiight be able to reach every black tile that doesn't have a rock on it? Let's try that first.

### Notes

- Note to self: you may need to run `eval $(opam env)` before taking the next steps

- To build the program, run `ocamlc -o solve_part_[1-2] solve_part_1.ml` from this directory

- To run the program, run `./solve_part_[1-2]` from this directory after building the program
