### Retrospective

That was pretty fun!

Funny note - in Part 2 I lazily hard-coded the seed ranges for the test input, intending to come back later to code them properly for the challenge input. When I finished my main code, I had forgotten about adjusting the seed ranges and just ran the program. While I was waiting for it to finish, I got bored and decided to optimize my algorithm.

The funny part is that if I had coded the seed ranges properly from the start, my non-optimized code would have actually gotten the the correct answer before I got bored waiting to it to finish and decided to optimize it!

For what it's worth, my non-optimized code would have gotten the correct answer in a little over 24.2 million cycles (if the the answer had been different (different data in a similar shape), it could have taken over 3 billion cycles). My optimized code (which I think has a maximum number of cycles around 240, but that could be a low estimate) got the correct answer in 2 cycles ðŸ˜Ž
