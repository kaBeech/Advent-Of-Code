### Retrospective

XXC.23 Day 9: Non-Latin-based Language (Arabic)

_This post is an entry documenting my journey working through the Advent of Code 2023 challenges using my Xtreme Xmas Code mod_

Challenge Modifier: "Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle while making declarations in a natural language using a non-Latin-based writing system (e.g. Arabic)"

When I first wrote this challenge modifier, I thought "Big deal. Make declarations in another language. Most of our code is in JavaScript or Python or whatever - how much of a difference does writing our declarations in another language make?"

When I look at my code after completing this challenge, I realize how much of the code we write is in natural languages rather than programming languages. If you look at my code, it's mostly in Arabic!

This challenge gave me a deeper appreciation of how much natural language plays into the code we write. Because we're writing code for other people to read at least as much as for computers to interpret, let's do our best to keep our writing clear and use our natural languages to their full potential.

Beyond all that, coding in Arabic is fun! Switching the line direction (Arabic is written right to left) is kinda weird, but it's not too hard to work around.

I've only been studying Arabic for a little over two years now, so this was good practice using these skills in the real world! Vocabulary is tricky of course, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I could write without having to look up words and phrases!

Plus, Arabic writing is just beautiful to admire. Look at that gorgeous code! ðŸ˜»

Thanks for joining me on this journey! If you'd like to see today's puzzle, it's over at Advent of Code. If you'd like to see my puzzle solutions, my source code is available on GitHub. And if you'd also like to give my mod a try, head over to Xtreme Xmas Code. Links to all three are in the comments!

Bonus: I just noticed a spelling/grammar mistake in the Arabic in my code in the screenshot for this post. If you can spot it and are the first to point it out to me, I'll write a LinkedIn post celebrating your intelligence and attention to detail!

ðŸŽ„ Happy holidays everyone! ðŸŽ„
