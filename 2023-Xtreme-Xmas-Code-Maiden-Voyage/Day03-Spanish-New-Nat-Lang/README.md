You know what? Actually. Let's reroll this. We've earned a break after yesterday.

"Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle while making declarations in a natural language not yet used in this codebase (e.g. Spanish)"

Ay, Â¡gracias a Dios!

XXC.23 Day 3: New Natural Language

_This post is an entry documenting my journey working through the Advent of Code 2023 challenges using my Xtreme Xmas Code mod_

Finally, a simple challenge!

Challenge Modifier: "Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle while making declarations in a natural language not yet used in this codebase (e.g. Spanish)"

My first roll on this day got a different modifier: "Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle using no numbers (you may convert any numbers in your challenge input)"

However, after my previous day's Carbon solving, I figured I deserved a break ðŸ˜¸

So I rerolled it, and I'm so glad I did!

This challenge was pretty straightforward. I used Spanish, so the biggest difficulty I had was misspelling words ðŸ˜… I briefly considered using using Arabic or Hindi, but I didn't really feel like making today's puzzle more difficult.

Thanks for joining me on this journey! If you'd like to see today's puzzle, it's over at Advent of Code. If you'd like to see my puzzle solutions, my source code is available on GitHub. And if you'd also like to give my mod a try, head over to Xtreme Xmas Code. Links to all three are in the comments!

ðŸŽ„ Happy holidays everyone! ðŸŽ„
