### Retrospective

- That was more interesting than I thought it would be. I almost rerolled my challenge modifier for this one. Having no named functions encouraged me to write more comments (especially during Part 1) and think more carefully in my object declaration (especially during Part 2). It was kinda fun working in a more OOP fashion for a change!
