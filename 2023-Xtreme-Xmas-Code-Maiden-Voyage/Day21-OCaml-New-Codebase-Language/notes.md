## Pseudocode

Domain is the 4 (four quadrants) * 64 (height of a quadrant) * 64 (width of a quadrant) / 2 (each quadrant is a triangular area) / 2 (since the Elf needs to take an even number of steps, if this were a chessboard, he could only land on black tiles) tiles that the Elf could theoretically reach. Looking at the map he miiiiight be able to reach every black tile that doesn't have a rock on it? Try that first.
