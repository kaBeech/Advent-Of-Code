### Notes

If you have Docker, the easiest way to run Node-RED is by running `docker run -it -p 1880:1880 --name mynodered nodered/node-red`. Otherwise, follow your preferred [instructions here](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local).

Once the Node-RED server is running, head to `http://127.0.0.1:1880/` (or wherever you hosted the server).

Once in the Node-RED application, right-click on an empty space on the grid, hover over `insert` in the menu that pops up, and click `Import` in the sub-menu that pops up. Then copy the code from `./flows.json` into the big empty space in the middle of the dialog box that pops up (or click `select a file to import` and find the file manually).

That will show the flow with the program in it (you may need to click on another tab that says `Flow 1`). Click the big red `Deploy` button in the top right of the window to initialize the program.

To run the test case, click the pale blue box to the left of the blue box that says `Test`. To run with the puzzle input, click the pale blue box to the left of the blue box that says `Solve`.

The results for both Part 1 and Part 2 will be shown in the Debug Messages window. The button to bring up this window is likely below the big red `Deploy` button, right between the book icon and the gear icon.

### Retrospective

XXC.23 Day 7: Node-RED

*This post is an entry documenting my journey working through the Advent of Code 2023 challenges using my Xtreme Xmas Code mod*

Visual programming for clarity and accessibility.

Challenge Modifier: "Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle using a random selection from the Visual Programming Box: Node-RED"

This is my first time doing much visual programming since middle school, and I gotta say I enjoyed it!

Node-RED is a visual programming tool that enables you to create, arrange, and connect elements in a visual plane, then open them up to write the code they contain as JavaScript.

I found this process intuitive and fun! One way to think of working with Node-RED is that it provides a simple visualization of your code as you write it.

Some see visual programming as inferior to text-based programming; a sort of training wheels to get you ready for the real stuff. I myself have had that bias, but lately it's been challenged by a couple very smart engineers (shoutout to the Future Of Coding community/podcast) who see it as a helpful tool for serious programming.

Visual tools can help programmers form a mental image of what's going on in the program. People have a great diversity in how we represent images in our minds. Some people don't conjure any mental images at all (a condition known as aphantasia).

As programmers, we all have different skills. People with aphantasia can be brilliant engineers, just look at Jimmy Miller! Visual tools can help people like Jimmy get a clearer image of what their programs are doing and help us all understand our code better.

Visual tools can also be helpful in cross-departmental communication. Let's say we're working at a company that builds cars. We're writing a program for assistive braking technology. The specifications for the program were given to us by a team of mechanical engineers and we are implementing it in our preferred language.

When we have meetings with the mechanical engineering team, we want to show them what our program is doing. These engineers are very smart and they understand what the program is supposed to do (they wrote the specs after all), but they might not be programmers and in any case are not fluent in the language we decided to build the program in.

If we show these engineers our code as text, we might receive befuddled affirmations of what they assume we are doing correctly, though they might not have a complete understanding of our code. But if we can show them a visual representation of our program, press the start button, and let them watch it in action, they will likely have a clearer understanding of what exactly our program is doing at each step in its execution. Heck, they might even see a potential issue in our code and (gasp!) provide helpful feedback!

Thanks for joining me on this journey! If you'd like to see today's puzzle, it's over at Advent of Code. If you'd like to see my puzzle solutions, my source code is available on GitHub. And if you'd also like to give my mod a try, head over to Xtreme Xmas Code. Links to all this and more are in the comments!
