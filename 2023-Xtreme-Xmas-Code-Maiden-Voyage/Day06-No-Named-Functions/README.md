### Challenge Modifier

"Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle without declaring any named functions"

OK, let's give this a shot!

...wait. That's my Challenge Input? I could probably just do this by hand...

Confirmed! But the challenge does say to write a program to do it so...

XXC.23 Day 6: No Named Functions

_This post is an entry documenting my journey working through the Advent of Code 2023 challenges using my Xtreme Xmas Code mod_

Is this puzzle from my middle school homework?

Challenge Modifier: "Your challenge is to write a program to complete today's puzzle without declaring any named functions"

After "yesterday's" challenge of taking breaks, I got sick and took a break from posting (though not as much of a break from the puzzles themselves). So for the next few days I'll be posting extra to catch up.

I had an easy time with today's puzzle.

Without going into too many spoilers (I decided to spice up my screenshots, so don't look too hard if you don't want spoilers), I realized pretty early on that the puzzle could be refactored into a pretty basic algebra equation which could be solved for to get the base solutions. Then I found out that the dataset for the puzzle was only four elements long.

So in the spirit of the challenge, I solved the puzzle not only without declaring any named functions, but without writing any code at all!

I then realized that I wrote the challenge to specify that I had to write a program to complete the puzzle, so I went back and wrote a program that did so.

Part 2 may be challenging if you're approaching the problem from a software development/more direct modeling perspective (due to increasing the computational load of, for example, brute forcing the answer), but in terms of solving it with algebra the change was trivial.

Which I suppose goes to show: anyone who said you'll never use middle/high school math in the real world may be working too hard at their "real job!"

Thanks for joining me on this journey! If you'd like to see today's puzzle, it's over at Advent of Code. If you'd like to see my puzzle solutions, my source code is available on GitHub. And if you'd also like to give my mod a try, head over to Xtreme Xmas Code. Links to all three are in the comments!
