### Imporove test coverage for early days

- Add tests to show the solutions to test files (like currently exists for
  Day 6)

### Some test asserts have Actual and Expected reversed. Fix that

### Add app.ts for Days 1-6

### Standardize style

    - I'm using this as a catch-all both to mean to make functionally idental code be sylistically identical and to update code in earlier Days with structure and methods implemented in later Days

### Possibly improve error handling for early days

### Possibly refactor Day 1

### Possibly refactor Day 5
