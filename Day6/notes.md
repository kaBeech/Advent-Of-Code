# Start Day 6

## Pseudocode

1. Wrap the input string as an array of one-character strings

2. Start a counter at 4

3. Shift the first four characters from the input array into a 
holding array

4. Check if all four characters are different. If they are, return 
the number stored in the counter. If not, move to Step 5

5. Add 1 to the counter

6. Shift the first character out of the holding array

7. Shift the first character out of the input array and push it into 
the holding array

6. Repeat Steps 4-7 until a number is returned!
