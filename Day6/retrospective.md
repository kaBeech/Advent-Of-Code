# What went well during the sprint?

### I stayed in the flow well!

Good job staying focused (including when pausing for breaks 
and coming back)!

### I took good breaks!

Remember how much better I work and feel when I take good breaks!

### I reused code from Day 5

It's good to keep an eye open for opportunities to reuse code, and 
in this challenge I got to breeze through some bits by converting 
the input string into an array and using the array funcitons I built 
for Day 5's challenge!

## Takeaways

* Look for opportunities to reuse code
* Stay in the flow
* Keep taking good breaks!
* Have fun!

# What can I learn from difficult points?

### Take breaks!

Not much from this one stands out as difficult to me. The hardest 
thing might have been getting myself to get up to take breaks. But 
I felt more productive while taking good breaks - it will be good 
to remember that breaks is good for me!

## Takeaways

* Breaks are good for me!

# Ideas for possible future implementaion

### Modularize further and use state when appropriate

See also Day 5 Retrospective. In this challenge I was able to 
modularize without using factory functions and state, but I will keep 
a lookout for good oppoortunities to incorporate them in future 
challenges!
