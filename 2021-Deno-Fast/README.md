# Advent-Of-Code-2021

Repository for my work on the Advent Of Code 2021 challenges

https://adventofcode.com/2021

## Basic Info

This is a speedrun! I'm using JS/TS with Deno and just going for the fastest path to a solution

To clarify: I'm speedrunning each day individually, not the entire group of 2021 challenges

For each Day I will include a time taken to complete (Part1, Part2, and Total). I will be running a stopwatch while I am at my computer working on the challenge. If I step away from my computer or switch to another task I will pause the stopwatch and resume it when I resume work on the challenge

- These completion times will be in either notes.md or retrospective.md

This folder was made to contrast with my Advent-Of-Code-2022 solutions, in which I am taking a more thorough approach

## Notes

Warning: files labelled notes.md are for scratch note-taking and much of their
content is not written with the intention of being readable for anyone besides
myself

- They do contain handy links to the pages for individual Days' challenges
  though!

## Retrospectives

Retrospectives contain reflections on that Day's work

## app.ts

Files labelled app.ts are runnable and will return that Day's solutions as well
as log solution messages to the console. They can be run from inside that Day's
directory by running `deno run --allow-read app.ts` in the terminal
