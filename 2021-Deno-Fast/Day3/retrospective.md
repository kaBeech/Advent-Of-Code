# What went well during the sprint?

### The updated boilerplate app.ts was very helpful!

- Good idea setting that up with comments of what code to add where

- Also having the dual output for test and challenge input was helpful

### Thinking outside the box!

- This is a little thing and maybe obvious, but I noticed that the gammaRate and epsilonRate were the binary inverse of each other (if that's a real term haha. I mean the 0's and 1's are flipped). This allowed me to calculate just one the long way and then derive the other by just flipping the digits. Keep doing things like this!

## Takeaways

- It may seem silly, but little things that help me to not have to think as much when coding is beneficial! Sort of like, setting things up to get out of my own way

- Keep thinking outside the box!

- Little things add up!

# What can I learn from difficult points?

### When in doubt, double check the question and reevaluate your approach!

- In part 2 I ended up refactoring my code and breaking it down into multiple parts. This is partly due to the digit-flipping hack mentioned in the previous section. My approach for Part 1 didn't transfer over cleanly to Part 2 and it took me a little while to notice that because I misunderstood part of the question. This may seem counterintuitive during a speed run, but taking the time to slow down and make sure you understand what you're doing can actually help you get to the solution faster!

### Even when coding quickly, typing and testing may be helpful

- I ran into some silly errors with this one (see above). This may have been alleviated with a little more structure to my approach. Maybe typing and testing don't need to be comprehensive in this environment, but having a little bit there may be useful

## Takeaways

- Slow down to move faster!

- Understand the question and your approach

- Add structure when helpful

# Ideas for possible future implementation

### Consider adding some typing and testing, even during speedruns!
