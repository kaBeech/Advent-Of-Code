# What went well during the sprint?

### That was fast and fun!

- Yeah!

###

- This is a real simple program, but I feel the code I used to get the correct solution is much more readable than Day 1's was

- This likely helped me get to the correct solution quickly!

### Destructively editing Part 2 app.ts = <3

- Copying the Part 1 app.ts fort archive also = <3
    - Just make sure to write the Part 2 app in the right file!

## Takeaways

- Have fun!

# What can I learn from difficult points?

### Remember to update input

- This time I had the opposite issue as Day1 - I forgot I was using testInput and wondering why my answer was off!

- Actually, I went ahead and edited my boilerplate app.ts so it runs both the testInput and the challengeInput. This way I don't have to remember as much - I just have to pay attention to the console!

## Takeaways

- Check inputs and outputs when necessary!

- But also, set things up so you don't have to remember to do as much!

# Ideas for possible future implementation

### Update boilerplate app.ts to include prompts for what code to enter where

### Use the lap function on your stopwatch!!

- That way you don't have to add your times together ;)
