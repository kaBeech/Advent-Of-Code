# What went well during the sprint?

### Adding error handling

It just so happened that this very next challange had a good opportinity to add
error handling! there wan't much needed, but it felt good to add some in, at
least for the practice

### Using previous Days' work as models

This sped up development. I added a boilerplates folder to the tools folder for
easy access in the future

## Takeaways

- Error handling is nice! And not too hard!
- Use boilerplates and reuse work whenever possible
- Have fun!

# What can I learn from difficult points?

### Read the question carefully and verify input formats!

I misread Part 2 to say that it was going to provide me with a new input which
had empty lines between each group of three rucksacks. Because of that I spent
quite a bit of time refactoring to take two input formats, choose a method based
on the format, and then process the input appropriately. I could save myself
some time in the future by reading carefully and verifying the format of
provided materials

### Verify the solution before making a 'solve' commit

It doesn't really harm anything, it just looks silly when the solution isn't
complete

## Takeaways

- Read questions carefully
- Verify input formats
- Verify solutions before making 'solve' commits

# Ideas for possible future implementaion
