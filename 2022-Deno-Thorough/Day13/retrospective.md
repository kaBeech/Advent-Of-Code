# What went well during the sprint?

### Use your resources!

Remember - instead of implementing a binary sort, you can use JavaScript's Array.prototype.sort() method! Instead of parsing the square brackets out of `[1,[2,[3,[4,[5,6,0]]]],8,9]`, you can just use JSON.parse()! I did a good job remembering to use the tools I already had available from my framework in this challenge.

## Takeaways

- Solutions come quickly when we don't reinvent the wheel!

- Have fun!

# What can I learn from difficult points?

### Type declarations are your friends!

I wouldn't necessarily say this was a difficult point - on the whole this challenge was a breeze. But I did get lazy in Part1 with declaring my packets as `number | Array<any>` instead of making a Packet type, which I ended up doing in Part2 anyway.

## Takeaways

- Type declarations are not as hard as they may seem, but they are often more helpful than we may originally realize!
