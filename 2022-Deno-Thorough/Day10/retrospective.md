# What went well during the sprint?

### That was fast and fun!

- After reading this challenge, I was like "Oh, I could just write this program real quick." Which I did, in more of a speedrun style... (Continued in 'What can I learn?' section) 

### Crunchy math and logic stuff

- Part of why I felt an urge to speedrun this is because it was relatively simple, enough that I could model it in my brain and just put it on the page. I enjoy these challenges where my brain stays in a "What logic do I need to apply here?" mode more than an "Okay, which JavaScript function is the 'most correct' one to use here?" mode

## Takeaways

- Math is fun. Logic is wholesome <3

- I like to work the logic part of my brain! This folder is more oriented towards code quality, but I would like an outlet that focuses more on crunchy math/logic stuff

# What can I learn from difficult points?

### Relax

- (Continued from 'What can I learn?' section) ...at like 2am or something. And had some weird output from my program. I played with it for a while, then was almost falling asleep so I went to bed. When I came back the next day, I quickly realized I had set one constant integer to an incorrect value, changed that, and got the correct output

- I had already solved Part 1 pretty quick, so I wanted to keep the speed up with Part 2. I did that, but in doing so worked through some silly mistakes that I might have noticed if I wan't rushing

### I have an itch do speedrun some challenges

- This was a lot of fun, but not really in keeping with the spirit of being thorough (in terms of code quality). I'm happy with the process, but I felt stuck in limbo between wanting to go fast and wanting to keep the code quality in this folder high. I felt frustrated and distracted and my code quality may have suffered. I may come back and modularize/write tests for this one, but for now I'm going to start another folder to speedrun some of the 2021 challenges

## Takeaways

- Relax

- Keep this folder for thorough solutions

- Let's do some speedruns!

# Ideas for possible future implementaion

### Start a speedrun challenge!

- I will start a new directory in this repo to do some of the challenges from 2021's Advent of code in a more speedrun style
