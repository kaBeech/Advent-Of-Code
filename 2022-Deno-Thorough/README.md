# Advent-Of-Code-2022

Repository for my work on the Advent Of Code 2022 challenges

https://adventofcode.com/2022

### Basic Info

I'm sticking to fundamentals: using JS/TS with Deno, not going for speed, just
seeing how far I get while building a progressively more sophisticated code base

I am also using this project as an opportunity to practice some Agile strategies
such as prioritizing working code, iterative/incremental/evolutionary
development, continuous refactoring, periodic retrospectives, SCRUM, Test Driven
Development, and Pair Programming

Naturally, later Days tend to contain more sophisticated code and strategies
than earlier ones

### Notes

Warning: files labelled notes.md are for scratch note-taking and much of their
content is not written with the intention of being readable for anyone besides
myself

- They do contain handy links to the pages for individual Days' challenges
  though!

### ToDo

ToDo contains known opportunities and fresh ideas for improving this project

### Retrospectives

Retrospectives contain reflections on that Day's work

### app.ts

Files labelled app.ts are runnable and will return that Day's solutions as well
as log solution messages to the console. They can be run from inside that Day's
directory by running `deno run --allow-read app.ts` in the terminal
