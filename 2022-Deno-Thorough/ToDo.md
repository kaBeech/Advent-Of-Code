### Imporove test coverage for early days

- Add tests to show the solutions to test files (like currently exists for
  Day 6)

### Some test asserts have Actual and Expected reversed. Fix that

- There's some more test cleanup that can be done as well

### Add app.ts for Days 1-6

### Standardize style

- I'm using this as a catch-all both to mean to make functionally idental code
  be sylistically identical and to update code in earlier Days with structure
  and methods implemented in later Days

### Possibly improve error handling for early days

### Possibly refactor Day 1

### Possibly refactor Day 5

### Possibly modularize, write tests, and handle errors in Day 10 (see Day 10 retrospective)
