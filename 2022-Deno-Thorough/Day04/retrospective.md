# What went well during the sprint?

### Adding function options

I like this method of solving Part 2 by passing method options to the fuctions!
It feels clean =)

## Takeaways

- Keep going, you're doing great!
- Have fun!

# What can I learn from difficult points?

### Feel free to move on when slogging through something non-urgent

For instance, when writing tests for the conversion functions. It was working
fine, and it's important to stay in the flow. We can always refactor later!
Refactoring is part of Agile development =)

### Take care of yourself

Your body is important. Eat, drink, sleep, excercize. Your spirit is important.
Relax. You don't have to do everything all at once. Make it a habit to take
regular breaks =)

## Takeaways

- Feel free to move on and refactor!
- Take care of your body/spirit
- Take breaks
