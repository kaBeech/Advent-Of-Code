# What went well during the sprint?

### Be confident in my value!

- I was a little nervous going into this event because most of my companions
  have been coding for a decade longer than I have and I was afraid of sounding
  dumb or having nothing to contribute. But I brought a lot of value! I'm a
  pretty sharp thinker and that is valuable even when I'm less familiar with the
  specific tools being used

- Obviously (well, to me anyway. I guess I what I mean here is that this is a
  strength I'm comfortable highlighting when I position myself to teams that are
  largely made up of other people who are also wicked smart and have more
  concrete evidence to prove it than I do), I bring a lot of valuable soft
  skills and leadership ability
  - I mean, this is kind of a place for me to brag, but more importanly it's a
    place for me to remind myself of my value that I sometimes overlook.
    Speaking to myself: You know how every team you're on tends to just work
    better and people seem to be capable of even more than they think they are
    when you're there? That's actually a super valuable trait, and maybe not
    something that's easy to objectively advertize to potential teammates, but
    it's something to remember for myself and to feel confident in knowing that
    when I am on a team I bring a lot of value

## Takeaways

- Be confident in my value!
- Have fun!

# What can I learn from difficult points?

### In time-sensitive situations, focus on the level of abstraction that you understand best

- In this group programming project, the two team members who handled most of
  the driving chose a more Object Oriented Programming approach, while I prefer
  a more Functional Programming-focused style. At times I had difficulty
  following the specifics of the syntax they were writing and I spent effort
  untangling in my head the details of what exactly they were writing and why,
  while I understood the larger goals we were working to accomplish

- Sometimes I would have an idea, then not be sure if it fit into the syntax
  that was already written, so I would puzzle it out quietly, usually until I
  spoke up saying something like "Ok, I'm not actually sure whether this works
  with what we have, but it seems like we're doing X and I'm wondering why we
  aren't trying Y. Is there a good reason we can't do that?" Sometimes someone
  else was wondering the same thing while also working to wrap their head around
  the issue and it led to a greater understanding for all of us. Often this
  would contribute to a breakthrough that propelled us to a better solution

- This is not an excuse for me to avoid getting comfortable with using classes
  for when that's a more beneficial or pragmatic approach! But it is a good
  thing to keep in mind when working in a time-sensitive situation that I don't
  always have to focus on the little details when the system as a whole makes
  sense to me

## Takeaways

- Be courageous in asking questions and offering suggestions, even if I haven't
  completely figured it out yet myself!

- Focusing on a level of abstraction that I understand well can lead to valuable
  results even when other levels of abstraction are less clear to me
