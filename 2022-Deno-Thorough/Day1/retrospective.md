# What went well during the sprint?

### People are interested and having fun!

I didn't really expect that many friends/colleagues of mine would jump in and do
this with me, but we actually have a fun little group going through this
together and comparing notes! I feel silly because I helped get so many people
excited about it and I'm so far behind now. I want to catch up so I can comare
with everyone's answers! Hopfully the rest of the month will be more conducive
to coding for me =)

### Most things!

Honestly, once I got my workstation set up and basic things figured out it was
pretty simple to complete the riddle. And I solved it in a way that seems on par
with my companions, even those who have been coding professionally for a decade
longer than me. So I feel good about that!

## Takeaways

- Learn from each other!
- Have fun!

# What can I learn from difficult points?

### Keep it simple (at the start)

I started out making a module for each function and linking them up, but this
proved more complicated than it was seeminlgly worth. We can always refactor
later. A goal for this project is to stay in the flow and solve the puzzles
directly

### Just use Deno!

I made the questionable decision of doing this project on a fresh computer, and
let me tell ya - Deno is so much quicker and simpler to set up from scratch than
Node.JS! I started out using Node.JS because I have more experience with it and
figured it would be quicker and easier to remember how to do anything unusual in
Node.JS than it would be to try to figure out something I've never tried in Deno
before. The opposite proved to be the case and I plan to continue using Deno for
the remainder of this project

## Takeaways

- Keep it simple
- Stay in the flow
- Use Deno!

# Ideas for possible future implementaion

### Add testing

Decide whether or not to implement based on availability of time and complexity
of tasks
