## Pseudocode

- wrap inventory string into an array of strings of numbers

- wrap each array of strings of numbers into an array of numbers (so that now we
  have an array of arrays of numbers)

- add up all numbers in each inner array and push the sums into a new array (of
  sums)

- find the largest number in this array
