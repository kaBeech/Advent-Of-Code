### Notes

Similar to Day 1, I'll use TypeScript and Deno. Again, to run this program you'll need into navigate to the Day1 directory, then run `deno`. Inside the Deno REPL, run `import {solvePart1} from "./solvePart1.js"` followed by `solvePart1` for the solution to Part 1. For Part 2, replace `...Part1` with `...Part2`
