### Challenge Modifier

"You must complete this challenge using a random selection from the Esoteric Programming Box: Chef"

Goodness. Well, while we're waiting for Perl to install let's write some pseudocode

...well, I solved Part1 with TypeScript while pseudocoding, I got a Chef interpreter working, and I got an ingredients list written. But I'm having a little difficulty with the apparent lack of conditionals and looking at Part2 I think it might be better to reroll...

"You must complete this challenge without reassigning any variables"

Let's goooooo!
