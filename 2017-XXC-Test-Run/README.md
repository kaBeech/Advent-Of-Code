# Advent-Of-Code-2017

Repository for my work on the Advent Of Code 2017 challenges

https://adventofcode.com/2017

## Basic Info

This year's set of solutions are a test run for my [Xtreme Xmas Code](https://github.com/kaBeech/xtreme-xmas-code) mod

I'll stick with Deno/TS by default and I don't plan on taking it too hardcore

## Public Link

[This game on Xtreme Xmas Code](https://www.xtremexmascode.com/game/public/1/)

## About.md

Files labelled about.md contain links to that day on Xtreme Xmas Code and information about that day (which Challenge Modifiers were rolled, evidence of Challenge Modifier completion, any additional information, etc.)

## Notes

Files labelled notes.md are for scratch note-taking and much of their
content is not written with the intention of being readable for anyone besides
myself

- They do contain handy links to the Advent of Code pages for individual Days' challenges
  though!

## app.ts

Files labelled app.ts will usually be runnable and return that Day's solutions as well as log solution messages to the console. They can generally be run from inside that Day's
directory by running `deno run --allow-read app.ts` in the terminal. However, this is all subject to the Day's rolled Challenge Modifiers
