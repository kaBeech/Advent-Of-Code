### Challenge Modifier

Part 1: "You must complete this challenge making your code as clear as possible, but using no comments"

That was pretty simple, and Part 2 doesn't change the solution much. Let's reroll for Part 2!

Part 2: "You must complete this challenge using a random selection from the Object Oriented Programming Box: Scala"

Sweet! I've got a meeting to go to, but after that I'm learning some Scala!

### Rerolls

#### Tokens Spent

### Tokens Earned

### Notes

To run Part 1, use `deno run --allow-read solvePart1.ts` from within the Part1-no-comments directory

To run Part 2, install Scala, then use `sbt` from within the Part2-scala directory. Inside sbt, enter `~run`
