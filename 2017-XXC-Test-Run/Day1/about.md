### Notes

Since this is a test run for my XXC site, I'm not gonna be too hardcore about getting this app size super small. I'll do it in Deno and make an effort to keep things small. I'll also do it in JavaScript because I imagine that makes the application smaller than it would be in TypeScript

In the interest of keeping a small app size, to run this program you'll need into navigate to the Day1 directory, then run `deno`. Inside the Deno REPL, run `import {p1} from "./p1.js"` followed by `p1` for the solution to Part 1. For Part 2, replace `p1` with `p2`
